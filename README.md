# SteelTimer
Simple multi-timer, with the ability to add more time in 80 minute increments.

Push start once your finery forge is filled with 9 coals. When you add coal to the forge, push the add coal button for each coal you put in.
Can go past fuel limits if you push at the wrong time, so only push when you need it.

*Needs*
-Preventative coding to stop people for fill past amounts.
-State saving. This timer needs to run for 2 days and 8 hours, so if it resets or any timing data is lost in that time it would be not good.
-Notes.. I need to go through and put in notes for all of the methods for sure... 
-Different values for certain aspects of the game i.e. Total number of coals used / total number needed, 
current fuel level / max fuel level, percentage of steel completion.
